# 🧠 NexusRAG: Grounded RAG System

> **Production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with Hybrid Retrieval (FAISS + BM25), Citation Verification, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker, and LLM-powered Question Answering.**

A modular, production-oriented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform that provides **grounded, citation-backed responses** over large document collections. The system combines semantic retrieval, keyword search, cross-encoder reranking, metadata filtering, and citation verification to reduce hallucinations and improve answer reliability.

Although the current implementation demonstrates the system using **clinical guidelines**, the architecture is **domain-independent** and can be adapted to legal documents, financial reports, enterprise knowledge bases, research papers, policy documents, and technical documentation.

# ✨ Key Highlights

Unlike many demo RAG projects, this system includes several production-oriented features.

### Hybrid Retrieval

Combines

- Dense Retrieval (FAISS)
- Sparse Retrieval (BM25)

using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

---

### CrossEncoder Re-ranking

Initial retrieval results are re-ranked using a CrossEncoder model to significantly improve retrieval quality.

---

### Metadata Filtering

Supports retrieval filtering using structured metadata such as

- Source Organization
- Document Type
- Category
- Version
- Section
- Page Number

---

### Citation Verification

Every generated citation is validated against the retrieved document metadata before being returned.

This provides an additional safeguard against hallucinated references.

---

### Audit Trail

Every query records

- User Question
- Retrieved Documents
- Citations
- Grounding Score
- Latency
- Timestamp

for traceability and debugging.
